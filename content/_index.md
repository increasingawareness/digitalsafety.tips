<center>

# <i class="fas fa-user-shield" id="browser"></i> Browse safely 

Chrome and Safari are two of the safest browsers.

 <a href="https://chrome.com"><img src="/img/chrome.svg" alt="Chrome" height="100" align="center"></a>
 <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/"><img src="/img/safari.svg" alt="Safari" height="100" align="center"></a>

## Chrome Desktop Add-Ons

These add-ons for Chrome can be useful for a better desktop browsing experience. Chrome can be used across all platforms, whereas Safari is only available on Apple products. 

 [Ublock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)    
 [Cookie Autodelete](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-autodelete/fhcgjolkccmbidfldomjliifgaodjagh)  


Note that using any browser on iOS/iPadOS results in using the underlying WebKit browser engine from Apple that powers Safari. The only real advantage to using Chrome on those devices would be to sync bookmarks if you use Chrome elsewhere. If you are in the Apple ecosystem, it would make more sense to just stick with Safari.

## <i class="fas fa-clipboard-check"></i> Browser setup


Switch the search engine to duckduckgo in the browser settings (both Chrome and Safari).

<a href="https://duckduckgo.com"><img src="/img/duckduckgo.svg" height="100" alt="duckduckgo"></a>

If you're not on a Chromebook, or don't want data to be synced with Google, you may want to uncheck 'allow Chrome sign-in.'

# <i class="fas fa-shield-alt" id="ads"></i>  Block most ads and trackers

[AdguardDNS](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html) is a service that keeps you safer and reduces intrusive ads.

## Android

On Android, you'll want to go to settings and search for: Private DNS. Add `dns.adguard.com` to the "Private DNS provider hostname" field. Switch airplane mode on and then back off in order to reset the DNS. That's it! You're successfully blocking ads everywhere you go.


## iOS/iPadOS

You'll want to install the [AdguardDNS](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html) app, following their instructions for setup.

## All other systems (Mac, Windows, ChromeOS, etc.)

Most other systems should be using the Ublock Origin extension in Chrome as discussed above (it can also be used in Microsoft's Edge browser). 

Another option is to use the [AdguardDNS](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html) app if using a browser like Safari or other desktop browsers that don't support Ublock Origin.

# <i class="fas fa-comments" id="signal"></i> Keep conversations yours

## Signal Messenger for Mobile and Desktop



<a href="https://signal.org"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Signal-Logo.svg" height="200" alt="Signal"></a>




</center>

Signal is a fun and peer-reviewed messaging app that allows you to connect in a way that respects you. Signal is non-profit, supports video/audio calls, messaging, Giphy, and group chats (and group video). It's available on iOS, Android, MacOS desktop, Windows desktop, and Linux desktop. Make your conversations with people just between you and them, not between you and a company that sees you as a product.

# <i class="fas fa-key" id="passwords"></i> Use passwords wisely

</center>

Every account should have its own unique password because it is dangerous to reuse the same password or a variant of the same password across sites. It's unlikely that most people will remember a unique string of characters for every login, so it's recommended to use a password manager to store passwords securely. 

A password manager generates new passwords for you, and stores them until you need them. All you need to remember is one passphrase that protects all the other ones. As long as the password manager has a strong passphrase and a second-factor code to unlock it, the passwords will stay safe.

<br>
<center>

## Create passphrases

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware"><img src="/img/dice.jpg" height="200" alt="dice"></a>

</center>

A passphrase is usually longer and more memorable than the shorter but harder to remember password. You'll need a master passphrase for your password manager which is best accomplished with the [Diceware method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware). This method involves rolling physical die to randomly select 6 to 7 words from a word list. One simply strings these words together, all as one word and creates a mnemonic to remember it. 

Despite what you may have heard from other sources, the math behind this method is sound since "a six-word passphrase would take 3,505 years, on average, at a trillion guesses a second."[^1] 

For now, we'll create two passphrases this way: one for your password manager and one for your home computer. Passphrases are mainly good at securing top level information like your computer login, password managers, or keys. For all your accounts (email, bank, social media, etc.), you'll want to use passwords generated with a password manager.

1. Go to [EFF's diceware list](https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt)
2. Roll a die 5 times (or you can roll 5 dice once) and write down the numbers in groups of five on a piece of paper.
3. Do this 6 times. Believe it or not, this is the basis for your first passphrase which will protect your password manager.
4. Once you have done this, find the corresponding words in the word list and write them next to the numbers
5. Create a mnemonic story with the words
6. Write down the 6 generated words on a piece of paper that will fit in your wallet. 
7. This is your master password for your password generator
8. Do not use it anywhere else.
9. Repeat this process to create the second passphrase for your computer login (or if using a passcode on an iPad or phone, use a ten sided die for a ten character passcode).
10. Shred the paper that you've carried with you after you've sufficiently memorized both passphrases. With a good mnemonic story, it shouldn't take longer than a week.

## Bitwarden password manager

<a href="https://bitwarden.com"><img src="/img/bitwarden1.png" height="200" alt="bitwarden"></a>

</center>

Bitwarden is a password manager that has undergone security audits, encrypts your passwords without being able to access them, is open source, free, and multi-platform. You can even securely share passwords with others. If you're technically apt, you can even host your own server. I recommend using the app on mobile and the browser plugin on desktop.

<center>

<br>
<br>

---
# <i class="fas fa-mobile-alt" id="2fa"></i> Passwords aren't enough. Use 2FA.

</center>

Security is strongest in layers, with passwords being only the first layer in the system. Most people carry a phone which can easily be used as a second layer of security. 2FA (2 factor authentication) usually works by entering a code from your phone after using your password to login, ensuring you are the only person who can access the account. 



<br>

There are three main types of authentication:

<center>

| Type of authentication                                | How it works                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Text message or phone call                            | Get an automated text or phone call and enter the code you read or hear.                           |
| App on your phone                                                  | Copy the time based code from an app on your phone or get a push notification.                                                |
| A security key such as a Yubikey | Press a button on the device or tap the device to your phone. |

<br>

</center>




Prefer security keys over apps, prefer apps over text message authentication. Text message based 2FA is better than not having any at all.




<p class="message"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Note that security questions don't count as a second-factor. Security questions are very easy to guess or find out about a person, and are extremely risky to use in place of the above  methods. If you must use a security question, I recommend using a random string of characters as the answer to the question. Then save it in your password manager.</p> 

<center>

## Security Keys

</center>

> ‚ÄúEven highly-targeted users like politicians and activists don‚Äôt fully appreciate the scourge of phishing, and many aren‚Äôt familiar with an emerging form of two-factor authentication known as ‚ÄúSecurity Keys‚Äù that we hope can stop it in its tracks ‚Ä¶ phishing is the silent killer, and relying on a password alone is a recipe for disaster. üîê‚Äù -Mark Risher‚Äôs Phishing and Security Keys

Security keys are the future of authentication. App based or text-message based codes are now considered to be legacy authentication. We are moving to an era when security keys are the main path to both authentication and passwordless systems. A few larger services such as Google, Microsoft, Dropbox, Github, Facebook, and Twitter currently support security keys.  [Dongleauth](https://www.dongleauth.info/) is a site that shows what current services work with security keys. 


<center>

<a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5-nfc/#yubikey-5-nfc"><img src="/img/yubikey.jpg" height="200" alt="yubikey"></a>

</center>

The security key I currently recommend is the [Yubikey 5 NFC](https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5-nfc/#yubikey-5-nfc).


There are a variety of types to fit your needs. Most likely you'll want the Yubikey 5 series which supports the newest standards. If you have a newer Macbook, Chromebook, or 2020 iPad Pro, you'll want to make sure to get a USB-C compatible Yubikey.

You'll want two of them (one is a backup).

## 2FA Apps


### Aegis for Android

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beemdevelopment.aegis"><img src="/img/aegis.png" height="100" alt="aegis"></a>

<p class="message"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Important‚ÄîAegis has the ability to backup security keys to wherever you would like. It is highly recommended to keep consistent and encrypted backups of your 2FA keys.</p>

<br>
<center>

### Tofu for iOS

<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/tofu-authenticator/id1082229305"><img src="/img/tofu.svg" height="100" alt="Tofu"></a>
<br>

<p class="message"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Important‚Äî2FA keys are stored on your iPhone's secure keychain, so only iTunes/iCloud encrypted backups will include a backup to these keys. If you're restoring your device from an iTunes/iCloud backup, the app and all keys will be restored as well.</p>

<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com"><img src="/img/hibp2.png" alt="haveibeenpwned"></a>

</center>

Created by security expert Troy Hunt, "Have I been Pwned?" is a service that keeps track of data breaches. Pronounced "pone," pwn is internet slang for "to own" or to conquer to gain ownership. Enter your email at the site to see if any of your accounts have been breached. If anything has been breached in the past, don't panic. Go to the website that was breached and change your password there. Be sure [to subscribe](https://haveibeenpwned.com/NotifyMe) to get notified of further breaches right away. Do this for each email you use.

# <i class="far fa-envelope" id="email"></i> A Note on Email.

</center>

Email is fundamentally a non-private protocol, you should use Signal Messenger to keep your conversations private.

> Encrypting email is asking for a calamity. Recommending email encryption to at-risk users is malpractice. Anyone who tells you it‚Äôs secure to communicate over PGP-encrypted email is putting their weird preferences ahead of your safety.

> -[Latacora](https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html#)

This is not to say that email is insecure. Security and privacy are facets of digital safety rather than a simple binary decision. This is why I advocate that **most people should use Gmail and activate Google's [Advanced Protection Program](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/).** Email security is important. We sign up for most accounts with an email address which means that all reset-password-links are sent to that email address. If someone has access to your email or successfully phishes your email, it could be game over for the rest of your accounts. As far as mainstream email providers go, Google has by far the best security with its Advanced Protection Program. 

If you object to using Google's services, [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com) supports using security keys and may be a reasonable alternative.

## And what about phishing?
 
 > "Phishing is when a scammer uses fraudulent emails or texts, or copycat websites to get you to share valuable personal information ‚Äì such as account numbers, Social Security numbers, or your login IDs and passwords. Scammers use your information to steal your money or your identity or both. Scammers also use phishing emails to get access to your computer or network then they install programs like ransomware that can lock you out of important files on your computer. Phishing scammers lure their targets into a false sense of security by spoofing the familiar, trusted logos of established, legitimate companies. Or they pretend to be a friend or family member." -[Federal Trade Commission](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing)

</center>

In general:

- If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.
- Don't open or download files or click on links in emails from a source you don't know.
- [If it's a supposed government agency, they will get a hold of you by official means (the IRS will never call you, they will send you postal mail)](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/how-to-know-its-really-the-irs-calling-or-knocking-on-your-door).
- [It's easy to be fooled by visual similarities](https://twitter.com/glenmaddern/status/1278252319646367744?s=20), always verify who is contacting you. Using a password manager and a security key can help with this.
- [Pay attention to browser alerts and security exceptions](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-does-your-connection-is-not-secure-mean).
- ["loose-lips sink ships"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security)
- ["The Internet is forever"](https://www.inc.com/meredith-fineman/what-we-post-online-is-forever-and-we-need-a-reminder.html)
- Only hand out information ["on a need-to-know basis"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEiu7uYCfPE)
- Avoid using [novelty apps](https://business.financialpost.com/technology/tim-hortons-app-tracking-customers-intimate-data) or even [some social media apps](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304228/tiktok-security-ios-clipboard-access-ios14-beta-feature).
- Only install apps you need or have reason to trust.


Verifying who people are and what they are doing is essential when dealing with tech support, financial institutions, or businesses. This process helps you avoid [social engineering](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014). In general, don't allow people to remote access your computer unless your business-place has this setup to begin with. 




<p class="message"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Additionally, avoid using "smart" appliances or home assistants (Amazon's Alexa, Google Home, etc.). These are set up to listen in constantly, using the information from your everyday life as a means for profit.</p>

# <i class="fas fa-cloud-upload-alt" id="backup"></i>  "Consider each piece of data you create and what would happen if you lost it, or if it leaked to the public at large. Make backups accordingly." -Security Researcher [Alec Muffett](https://medium.com/@alecmuffett/your-cyber-5-a-day-1f9fa1cb3067)
</center>

The cloud is not a bad place to store some types of data. It depends on what you want to do and who you trust. Apple seems fairly reasonable and iCloud may be a good resource for storing family photos or other files. If you have the advanced protection program with Gmail, you also have the same protection if you decide to upload photos (this pertains to security only, not privacy). However, this is all about who you trust to keep your data private. New solutions [are in development](https://github.com/cloudflare/utahfs) to keep data secure in a zero-knowledge way (where the cloud provider can't see your data even if they wanted to). If you want to use tools like Google Drive or Dropbox: that's fine, just remember that someone else may have access to that information.

Keep backups. If you've decided to keep everything in the cloud for backups, it's still recommended to have an offline backup on an external drive to increase redundancy (in information integrity, redundancy is a good thing). Store this someplace safe, and make sure the backup is encrypted. 

Safe ways to backup your data to external media:

- For [iOS/iPadOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205220)
- For Windows, you'll want to [create a system image](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore) and save it to an external drive [using Veracrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html).
- For MacOS, you'll most likely want to use the [integrated Time Machine backup app](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) (don't forget to check the encrypt backup checkbox). 


Mainstream cloud storage providers:

- https://drive.google.com
- https://icloud.com
- https://dropbox.com

Cloud backup providers that support zero-knowledge backups (where the provider can't see your data) by default:

- https://sync.com (Most platforms)
- https://Borgbase.com (MacOS, only for technical users)
- https://tarsnap.com (MacOS, only for technical users)

Every week there are dozens of [new security vulnerabilities reported](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/bulletins) that need to be patched. Most devices are patched monthly. Devices are complicated and require constant adjustments to code for each specific device that is made. Sometimes there are even issues with the way the hardware is structured on the device. Eventually, devices aren't supported anymore and need to be replaced. Devices without security updates are dangerous and should not be used.

## <i id="computer"></i> What kind of computer should I get?

</center>

Choices: iPad Pro, Pixelbook Go Chromebook, Macbook air, or a PC that can run Windows 10 S.


### iPad Pro

Apple has gone great lengths to protect their users privacy and security. An iPad Pro paired with the Magic Keyboard is a great choice for the user who wants a solid, long-lasting, all around well-performing device. Additionally, Apple is currently in the process of switching all of their Mac lineup to the same or similar chips that are in the iPad pros. This means native app support for Microsoft Word and other mainstream desktop apps on iPad. The current generation iPad Pros are ahead of Macbooks in terms of security. The iPad Pro (2020) paired with the Magic Keyboard is the current front-runner for digital safety.

### Pixel Book Go Chromebook

ChromeOS is developed first by the open-source team behind Chromium. Google then adds in their stuff to make ChromeOS. Modern Chromebooks like the Pixel Book Go are also able to run Android Apps natively. If you're a developer, you can also run a linux shell and have access to SSH. For an in-depth view at how the Chromium team is approaching security, [read this page.](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/security-overview)

### Macbook Air

The Macbook Air is the jack-of-all-trades machine in this set of choices. It has a good balance of computing power, traditional desktop computing, and Apple's signature dedication to privacy. It's not as advanced on the security front as the 2020 iPad Pro, but the M1 Mac lineup (the newer ones with the M1 chipset) is the runner up. Additionally, if you think you want to get into programming or like to run shell commands this is most likely the right choice for you.


### PC that runs Windows 10 S


> Windows 10 in S mode is a version of Windows 10 that's streamlined for security and performance, while providing a familiar Windows experience. To increase security, it allows only apps from the Microsoft Store, and requires Microsoft Edge for safe browsing. -[Windows 10 S FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4020089/windows-10-in-s-mode-faq)

<p class="message">If you are a non-techie, feel free to ignore this blurb. Before fellow privacy nerds freak out, I will just say: I agree with you on principle, it would be better for all things to have source code published and code developed in an open democratic way (and copyleft or creative commons). I get it. But, the Linux kernel and distro security management (I'm looking at you Debian), are light-years behind MacOS, AOSP, or Windows. I used to believe that Linux was more secure. That was what the community told me at least. It wasn't until I started digging that I found problems. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/11/05/net-of-insecurity-the-kernel-of-the-argument/?noredirect=on">This piece in the Washington Post details the issue pretty well.</a> I don't believe you can have privacy (one of the three aspects of digital safety) without security. Voyeurs would have there way without locks on doors. Privacy can't be had without security. Secrets leak without proper security management.
</p>

> In general, the assumption that open source software is any more secure or even private in practice is totally wrong and not based on reality.

## <i id="privacy"></i> Why should I care about privacy? I don't have anything to hide.

</center>

I found that these two quotes best sum up the issue:

>  Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, "I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide." I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, "Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide." Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.  
> - Glenn Greenwald [Why privacy matters - TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters)

and

> Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.

## <i id="vpn"></i> Should I use a VPN?

</center>

You can use a commercial VPN if you want, but remember: "A VPN is an ISP"

Privacy and anonymity researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis points out that using a virtual private network (VPN) doesn't keep you anonymous. Rather, you're taking the burden of potential surveillance and moving it from your current Internet service provider (ISP) and moving it to another by using a VPN. This doesn't mean "don't use a VPN". It means treat your VPN just like an ISP. If you need anonymity, use the tor browser. VPNs are most useful when you need to securely connect to a network, not if you want privacy.

## <i id="router"></i> More technical step: What kind of router should I get?

</center>

Some consumer routers are outdated and insecure. In 2018, the U.S. government [advised that U.S. citizens reset their routers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/27/technology/router-fbi-reboot-malware.html) since the Russian government attacked and successfully subverted hundreds-of-thousands of routers throughout the world. Most consumer routers never get updated. These are actually small computers that need regular updates to patch for security issues or bugs. Additionally, the power that the ISP retains over the device is significant. Obtaining your own network equipment means that you are in control of your network and increase your digital safety.


### PFsense router and firewall with a wireless access point

[PFsense is an open source operating system](https://www.pfsense.org/) that specializes as a firewall, router, gateway, and more. Netgate [makes PFsense appliances that I recommend](https://www.pfsense.org/products/).

<center>
<a href="https://www.netgate.com/solutions/pfsense/sg-3100.html"><img src="/img/netgate.png" alt="netgate"></a>
</center>

In addition to the router, you'll need a wireless access point for WiFi. Pick up [a wireless access point, like one made by Ubiquiti](https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-lite/) and you should be set.

These two pieces of equipment ensure that your network is on the way to being more secure (look into making sure the firewall is turned on for your particular router). Securing a home network is out of the scope of this guide, but you may want to visit https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/ and the r/pfsense subreddit to ask questions or get ideas for setups.

### Disable biometrics temporarily

You'll want to temporarily disable unlocking your mobile device with a fingerprint or face. This will instead require you to enter password the next time you need to unlock your device. Remember that you don't need to unlock your device to use the camera. To do this:


#### On iOS


> [Press and hold the side button and either volume button for 2 seconds.](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-up-face-id-iph6d162927a/ios)

> After the sliders appear, press the side button to immediately lock iPhone.

> iPhone locks automatically if you don‚Äôt touch the screen for a minute or so.

> The next time you unlock iPhone with your passcode, Face ID is enabled again.


#### On Android devices

Open the settings and search for "lockdown" and enable the toggle. The option for lockdown mode will then show up when you hold down the power button from the main menu of your phone or the lock screen.
