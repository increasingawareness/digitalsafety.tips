# <i class="fas fa-key" id="passwords"></i> Use passwords wisely

Most people reuse the same password or a variant of the same password. This is actually dangerous. Each account should have a fully unique password. Since it's unlikely that most people will remember a unique string of characters for every login, we use a password manager to store our passwords securely. A password manager generates new passwords for you, and stores them until you need them. As long as the password manager has a strong passphrase and a second-factor code to unlock it, the passwords will stay safe.

## Create passphrases

<a href="https://bitwarden.com"><img src="/img/dice.jpg" height="200" alt="bitwarden"></a>

You'll need a master passphrase for your password manager. This is best accomplished with the Diceware method. The math behind this method is sound and since "a six-word passphrase would take 3,505 years, on average, at a trillion guesses a second,"[^1] for now, we'll create two passphrases this way: one for your password manager and one for your home computer. Passphrases are mainly good at securing top level information (your computer logon, password managers, or keys). For all your accounts (email, bank, social media), you'll want to use a password manager.

1. Write down 6 generated words on a piece of paper that will fit in your wallet. 
2. Create a mnemonic story with the words. 
3. This is your master password.
4. Do not use it anywhere else.

# <i class="fas fa-mobile-alt" id="2fa"></i> Passwords aren't enough. Use 2fa.


Security is strongest in layers. Your passwords are only the first layer. These days, most people carry a phone which can easily be used as a second layer. 2fa (2 factor authentication) usually works by entering a code from your phone after using your password to login. This ensures you are the only person who can access the account. Enable 2FA on all the accounts that you can. You can use text message authentication (where you get an automated message with a code) or app authentication (where you copy the code from an app), or even a specialized device like a Yubikey or Onlykey (see [next level steps](#nextlevel)). App authentication is preferred for most people, but text message authentication is better than nothing, as some services only offer text message based 2FA.

# <i class="fas fa-skull-crossbones" id="phishing"></i> Phishing, scams, remote access

In general:

If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.



Verify that you are seeing "https" when visiting websites.

## Inspect emails carefully

</center>

> Phishing is when a scammer uses fraudulent emails or texts, or copycat websites to get you to share valuable personal information â€“ such as account numbers, Social Security numbers, or your login IDs and passwords. Scammers use your information to steal your money or your identity or both. Scammers also use phishing emails to get access to your computer or network then they install programs like ransomware that can lock you out of important files on your computer. Phishing scammers lure their targets into a false sense of security by spoofing the familiar, trusted logos of established, legitimate companies. Or they pretend to be a friend or family member. -[Federal Trade Commission](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing)

Don't click on links from emails you don't know.

Don't open or download files from a source you don't know.

Keep it secret; keep it safe.

## Don't trust; verify.

# <i class="fas fa-cloud-upload-alt" id="cloud"></i> Be your own cloud

 Usually, a cloud is comprised of a specific companies servers. Servers are just computers and storage devices that are accessible over a network. In this case, when you access something on Apple's cloud, Dropbox, Google drive, etc., your device is actually logging onto to that companies server and accessing from there. This solves a great many problems, but it creates a few weighty ones too. The weightiest is that your personal data exists on a device controlled by companies that want to make money off of you.
